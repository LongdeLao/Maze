(** Maze Generation using Eller's Algorithm:

  Eller's algorithm generates perfect mazes iteratively, one row at a time,
  using only O(width) memory regardless of maze size.

  1. Initialization
  1.1. Start with the first row
  1.2. Assign each cell in the row a unique set identifier
  
  2. For each row in the maze:
  
  2.1. Randomly connect adjacent cells within the row:
      - For each pair of adjacent cells in the row
      - Randomly decide whether to remove the wall between them
      - If removed, merge their sets (all cells in both sets now belong to the same set)
  
  2.2. Create vertical connections to the next row:
      - For each set in the current row, randomly select at least one cell
      - Remove the bottom wall of each selected cell
      - These cells propagate their set identifier to the cell below in the next row
  
  2.3. Initialize the next row:
      - Cells in the next row that don't have a set (weren't connected from above)
        are assigned new unique set identifiers
  
  2.4. Move to the next row and repeat
  
  3. Final row handling:
  3.1. For the last row, all cells with different set identifiers must be connected
       - Merge all adjacent cells that are in different sets by removing walls
